## Dependencies

This tool uses the `speedtest` library to measure internet speeds. However, if you're using the compiled version, you don't need to install any dependencies. Everything is bundled within the executable.

For developers or those running the script version, you'll need to install the `speedtest` library:

`pip install speedtest-cli`

## Usage

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/maksimkfive/SimpleSpeedTest/releases) section.
2. Run the downloaded file.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose the test mode and start the speed test.

## Notes

- The `.exe` file is compiled for Windows. If you need a version for another OS, please raise an issue.
- Some antivirus software might flag the `.exe` as potential malware due to the way it's compiled. This is a false positive.
