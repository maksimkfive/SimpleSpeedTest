## Dependencies

This tool uses the `speedtest` library to measure internet speeds. However, if you're using the compiled version, you don't need to install any dependencies. Everything is bundled within the executable.

For developers or those running the script version, you'll need to install the `speedtest` library:

`pip install speedtest-cli`

## Usage

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/maksimkfive/SimpleSpeedTest/releases) section.
2. Run the downloaded file.

## Notes

- The `.exe` file is compiled for Windows. If you need a version for another OS, please raise an issue.
- The test results are stored in the same directory as the executable file.
